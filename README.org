This package brings in the functionality to replace important keywords in a
Git message's header with icons specified by text properties of your choice.
This package is meant to work in line with the Git message conventions as
laid out in "Conventional Commits" https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

A typical Git message should be of the form where the text in angled brackets
are the default names for sections of the Git message:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>
  --BLANK LINE--
  <body>
  --BLANK LINE--
  <footer>
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Installation
To be able to use this package, fonts with icon support is required. A good,
free font that covers most icons that you would need is [[https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro][Source Code Pro]].

On Spacemacs, you can install this by adding the following to
=dotspacemacs-additional-packages=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default
   ...
   dotspacemacs-additional-packages
   '(...
     (pretty-magit :location (recipe
                              :fetcher github
                              :repo "arifer612/pretty-magit"))
     ...))
#+END_SRC

** Example configuration
The following configuration is an example that I use. It covers most of the
general header types that are recommended in [[https://www.conventionalcommits.org/][Conventional Commits]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package pretty-magit
    :after magit
    :hook (magit-mode . pretty-magit-mode)
    :config
    (pretty-magit-add-rule
     '((build
        :desc "Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies."
        :icon ?
        :props (:foreground "#00008B" :height 1.2))
       (chore
        :desc "Updating grunt tasks."
        :icon ?
